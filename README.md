# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Jose Antonio**, a Multiplatform Applications Developer based in **Seville, Spain**.  
I’m a software developer obsessed with the backend and with knowing every line of my code in detail.

I enjoy designing clean architectures, modelling data and building APIs that are easy to test, document and deploy.  
Right now I’m focused on improving my backend skills and DevOps practices while I am looking for a job.
